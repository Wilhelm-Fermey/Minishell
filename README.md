# Minishell

Minishell is a project at school 42 and the instructions were given in the subject. 

## About

  - The objective of this project is to create a simple shell to learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.

  - The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT. At the time, all coders agreed that communicating
with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously irritating. It was only logical that they came up with the 
idea to communicate with a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to english.
